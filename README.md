## About Me
I am a passionate software engineer with a diverse background that spans various creative and technical disciplines. Currently, I am engaged with AMPAworks, where I've played a pivotal role in developing and launching new features for both mobile and desktop platforms, including sophisticated admin dashboards and alert management systems that enhance user experience and operational efficiency. My work includes redesigning user flows and application UI, managing GraphQL schemas and database architecture, and introducing dynamic graph and chart views for data-driven decision-making.

Before this role, I worked as a Frontend Engineer at Code The Dream, where I made significant contributions such as quadrupling site performance by transitioning from Airtable to MongoDB. My user-centered design approach led to enhanced navigability and user engagement through intuitive layouts and interactive elements.

My earlier career included roles as a trial consultant and video producer, where I developed compelling trial presentations and spearheaded a video production arm that significantly boosted company revenue and client advocacy. This diverse experience has instilled a unique blend of creativity and technical proficiency that I bring to software development.

As a developer, Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of building intuitive products that merge my technical skills with my creative backgroundâ€”ranging from filmmaking to audio engineering. With extensive knowledge in languages and frameworks like JavaScript, React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and tools like GitHub and Figma, I am continually evolving and eager to innovate.

Outside of my professional work, I am a dedicated science and sci-fi enthusiast and an avid musician, playing instruments like the talkbox. Letâ€™s connect and explore the fascinating intersection of technology, science, and music!
