## About Me
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in React, React Native, TypeScript, and GraphQL.  My path began in filmmaking, music performance, and graphic design. After experiencing hearing loss, I discovered software development as a new creative outlet, allowing me to blend artistic expression with technical innovation.

With over three years of professional experience specializing in React, React Native, TypeScript, and GraphQL, I've built impactful applications for the medical and supply chain industries and crafted engaging websites for non-profits. My passion projects, like SampleSpaceâ€”a drum machine utilizing NASA space sounds (available [here](https://samplespace.surge.sh/))â€”reflect my commitment to merging creativity and technology.

Currently at AMPAworks, I've been instrumental in launching intuitive mobile and desktop platforms, including sophisticated admin dashboards and dynamic data visualizations that streamline decision-making and user experiences. Previously, as a Frontend Engineer at Code The Dream, I significantly enhanced site performance and user engagement by transitioning technologies and optimizing interfaces.

<!-- My earlier career involved producing compelling video evidence for trials, contributing to successful outcomes totaling millions of dollars. This diverse experience shapes my unique approach to software development, where user-centered design and creative problem-solving are paramount. -->

Outside work, I'm an avid sci-fi enthusiast and professional musician, notably performing with the talkbox.

Let's connect to explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and innovation!
